# SANTIAGO ESPINA - MovieFinder App

## Hello, this is a Mobile App that uses the [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/) api.

In this app you can: 

* Search movies by title
* See details of any movie
* Use dark mode

`The app was made with Expo, ReactNative, React and Redux. Is written with TypeScript.`

### You have to create a .env file and put your [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/) api key inside.

Your .env file has to look like this:

```
API_KEY=11abc111
```
> It is important that it be written as 'API_KEY'

### To run this app you'll need to be located in the root folder and run the next commands in the terminal:

> If you don't have expo globally I recommend installing it with the command: ```npm install --global expo-cli```

Then...

```js
npm install 
```
or
```js
yarn install
```

When all the dependencies are installed, execute:

```js
expo start 
```

When the expo devtools opens you can choose the way you want to see the app.

> Download the expo app in your cell phone store if you want to see it there.
